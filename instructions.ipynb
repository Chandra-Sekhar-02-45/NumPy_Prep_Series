    "# What is NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NumPy** (short for *Numerical Python*) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is an open-source library that provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A powerful **N-dimensional array object** (`ndarray`).\n",
    "*   Sophisticated **broadcasting** functions.\n",
    "*   Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.\n",
    "*   Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as the building block for many other data science libraries like **Pandas**, **SciPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**."

    "## Why use Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why we are using **Jupyter Notebooks** (`.ipynb`) instead of standard Python scripts (`.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Interactive Coding**: You can run code in small chunks (cells) and see the output immediately. This is perfect for data science where you want to inspect data at every step.\n",
    "2.  **Rich Text Support**: You can write formatted text (Markdown), add images, and write mathematical equations (LaTeX) alongside your code.\n",
    "3.  **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs appear directly below the code that generated them, making it easier to analyze results.\n",
    "4.  **Documentation**: It acts as a \"lab notebook\" where you document your thought process, code, and results in one document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on GitHub**:\n",
    "*   GitHub renders notebooks as static web pages. You cannot edit them directly in the standard GitHub view.\n",
    "*   If you don't see your outputs in GitHub, make sure you **run the cells** and **save** the notebook before pushing your changes."
